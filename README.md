# Geolocational-Analysis

This project involves the use of K-Means Clustering to find the best accommodation for
students in Hydrabad (or any other city of your choice) by classifying accommodation for
incoming students on the basis of their preferences on amenities, budget and proximity to
the location. This project is in association with Crio.Do project for Exploratory Analysis of Geolocational Data.

## Project Context

In the fast-moving, effort-intense environment that the average person inhabits, It’s a
frequent occurrence that one is too tired to fix oneself a home-cooked meal. And of course,
even if one gets home-cooked meals every day, it is not unusual to want to go out for a good
meal every once in a while for social/recreational purposes. Either way, it’s a commonly
understood idea that regardless of where one lives, the food one eats is an important aspect
of the lifestyle one leads.

Food delivery apps aside, managers of restaurant chains and hotels can also leverage this
information. For example, if a manager of a restaurant already knows the demographic of
his current customers, they’d ideally want to open at a location where this demographic is
at its highest concentration, ensuring short commute times to the location and more
customers served.If potential hotel locations are being evaluated, a site that caters to a wide
variety of tastes would be ideal, since one would want every guest to have something to
their liking.


## High-Level Approach

• Fetch Datasets from the relevant locations (Data Collection)

• Clean the Datasets to prepare them for analysis. (Data Cleaning via Pandas)

• Visualise the data using boxplots. (Using Matplotlib /Seaborn /Pandas)

• Fetch Geolocational Data from the Foursquare API. (REST APIs)

• Use K-Means Clustering to cluster the locations (Using ScikitLearn)

• Present findings on a map. (Using Folium/Seaborn)

The desired end result of this project is something like this:
